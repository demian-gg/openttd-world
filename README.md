**Important:** This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by OpenTTD. It was created independently to support the community and enhance the overall experience of the game.

This web-based tool lets you generate heightmaps from real-world locations for use in OpenTTD. Just pick any spot on the world map, adjust the size and resolution, and download a grayscale heightmap ready to import into the game.
